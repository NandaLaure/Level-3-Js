 Logical Programming Work On JavaScript.
 I implemented a function that sums numbers in a list using; For-loop, While loop and Do-while loop.
Concatenated numbers using the concat array method.
To return a list of digits from numbers, I used; toString to stringify the numbers,map and split array method.
